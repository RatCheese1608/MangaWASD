# MangaWASD
Creates a scrolling method using AutoHotKey and the shift+W,A,S,D as the scroll keys. Made for me to read manga.

> Script Optimization from [Autohotkey Forum](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=6413). Credits to user WAZAAAAA.

## Requirements
1. AutoHotKey. 
2. Windows `(Tested on Windows 10 but should be backwards compatible until Windows XP/Vista)`.

## How To Use
1. Make sure to AutoHotKey installed.
2. You can compile the script first and then run the exe or just directly run the script.
3. Use `shift` with `W`, `A`, `S` or `D` to scroll `up`, `left`, `down`, `right` respectively.

> To change the speed you must edit the script with a text editor like notepad and change the number after `SPEED:=`. A larger number means a smaller speed. It is recommended to keep it between 30-70 or the speed will be too fast or it won't scroll smoothly.
