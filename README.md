# MangaWASD
Creates a scrolling method using AutoHotKey and the shift+W,A,S,D as the scroll keys. Made for me to read manga.

## Requirements
1. AutoHotKey. 
2. Windows `(Tested on Windows 10 but should be backwards compatible until Windows XP/Vista)`.

## How To Use
1. Make sure to AutoHotKey installed.
2. You can compile the script first and then run the exe or just directly run the script.
3. Press `WIN` with `SPACE`, to enable scrolling
4. Press `W`, `A`, `S` or `D` to scroll `UP`, `LEFT`, `DOWN`, `RIGHT` respectively.
5. Press any key to disable it. (Known problem, gotta press the key kinda long sometimes, I made a tooltip so you can know.)

> Press `WIN`+`ALT`+`L` to enable 5 Wheel, which will allow the use of `A` or `D`, to scroll 5 times up or down respectively. (Made for sites with list view).

> To change the speed you can press `WIN`+`ALT`+`S` and it will open up a input box showing the current speed and will close within 9 seconds. Recommended to use 63-75. A larger number means a slower speed.
